# JSDS: JavaScript Data Structures & LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript Data Structures and LeetCode problem-solving journey! ðŸš€

## About

This repository documents my daily progress as I learn, implement, and master core data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. It also includes my solutions to various LeetCode problems, with a focus on building strong problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

## Structure

- **initial.js**: My first steps with basic algorithms (primes, factorial, sum of digits, etc.).
- **leetcode.js**: My LeetCode solutions, including explanations and iterative improvements.
- **README.md**: This file, summarizing my journey and goals.

## Goals

- Strengthen my grasp of JavaScript syntax and logic.
- Practice and master classic data structures and algorithms.
- Solve a wide range of LeetCode problems.
- Track my growth and reflect on my learning process.

## How to Use

- Browse the code files to see my solutions and learning notes.
- Each function is self-contained and can be run independently.
- Use the code as a reference or inspiration for your own learning journey!
